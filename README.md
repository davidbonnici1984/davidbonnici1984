Creator of OPENA3XX which it is an ambitious project for all Airbus flight simmers. The aim of the project is to build a home affordable Airbus cockpit made of open source tools, hardware, and software. Real Airbus pilots is also consulting to the look & feel, behaviour and functionality! At this point, our goal is to have a DIY cockpit integrated fully with the A320 Flybywire mod in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
